# Interpolation_CUPY
The cupy verson of cubic spline interpolation which is transferd from scipy.interpolation

You need an Nvidia GPU to run this. The main function is CuCubicSpline.CubicSpline(), which same as [scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline.html) but much faster.
